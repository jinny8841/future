오늘 하늘의 <strong><u><a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/PostView.nhn?blogId=leita03&logNo=221092893592&proxyReferer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F" target="_blank" title="석양입니다">석양</a></u></strong>이 정말 <strong>예쁘다</strong>. <p>Johnny Kitagawa, one of the most influential figures in Japan's entertainment industry, has died at the age of 87.

For more than 50 years the agency he founded, Johnny & Associates, turned multiple bands into household names, including SMAP, Arashi and KAT-TUN.

Many of the artists he propelled to fame also became stars of TV shows.</p>

Kitagawa died at a hospital in Tokyo on Tuesday after suffering a stroke, Kyodo News reported.

He had collapsed and was admitted to hospital on 18 June, the Japan Times said, but the incident was kept secret.

His last days were spent with his trainees, who were said to be like "his children".<p style="magin-top:49px;">

"His final curtain came down with him wrapped in the love of his beloved children," said a statement from his office.

Kitagawa was responsible for 232 number one singles between 1974 and 2010. He was recognised three times by Guinness World Records - for the most number one singles, the most number one artists and the most concerts produced by an individual.

But he rarely made public appearances or interviews, nor would allow himself to be photographed.
